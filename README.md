# Hugo Lithium (for notes)

This is a notes-oriented version of [hugo-lithium-search](https://github.com/woodwirk/hugo-lithium-search).

> This is a modified version of the Blogdown-optimized hugo-lithium theme. It includes search functionality via fuse.js and implements it statically, so that the feature works offline.
