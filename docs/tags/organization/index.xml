(Probably best approach) Use a headless bundle. The easiest way to do this is to make a new folder, move the content you want to hide, and create an index.md file in that folder. Make sure to include the headless parameter in the front matter, and set it to true. This allows you to keep your content organized in your notes, and you can separate working files (which may include markdown) from the content that shows on the site.</description></item><item><title>Front Matter</title><link>https://woodwirk.github.io/hugo-beryllium/hugo-usage/front-matter/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://woodwirk.github.io/hugo-beryllium/hugo-usage/front-matter/</guid><description>Front matter should be the first thing you add to a plain text file for this site, and it&amp;rsquo;s how you set the title of a page, date, authors, and taxonomy information like categories and tags. It&amp;rsquo;s required for the content pages of your website, and it&amp;rsquo;s also useful for organizing your notes offline.
This theme includes a references option in the front matter (refs) and also a keys parameter for future use.</description></item><item><title>Pages in Hugo</title><link>https://woodwirk.github.io/hugo-beryllium/hugo-usage/page-bundles/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://woodwirk.github.io/hugo-beryllium/hugo-usage/page-bundles/</guid><description>There are three main ways to make content for this site:
Loose Markdown (.md) files Leaf bundles Branch bundles Loose Markdown files This is probably the easiest method, and it works well if you don&amp;rsquo;t need to associate it with images or other files. You just write markdown, call the file whatever you want, put it in a folder, and you&amp;rsquo;re done. You can still include images, videos, and so on from online sources or the /static/ folder in your website files.</description></item><item><title>Taxonomies in Hugo</title><link>https://woodwirk.github.io/hugo-beryllium/hugo-usage/taxonomy/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://woodwirk.github.io/hugo-beryllium/hugo-usage/taxonomy/</guid><description>One way to organize the content in your notes and on the site is though taxonomies like tags and categories. This site will automatically show all of your taxonomy terms on the about page.
By default, Hugo uses tags and categories. If you want to use custom terms to organize your site, define your own terms in the format:
singular_taxonomy_term = 'front_matter_term'
Then edit the config.toml file to include a section like the following.</description></item></channel></rss>
