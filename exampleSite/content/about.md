This is an example website for rendering notes from plain text files using Hugo and the hugo-beryllium theme. It doubles as the example site some documentation.

The theme was forked from [@jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme](https://github.com/jrutheiser/hugo-lithium-theme) and [@yihui/hugo-lithium](https://github.com/yihui/hugo-lithium). Additionally, it includes:

- offline fuzzy searching from [fuse.js](https://github.com/krisk/Fuse) (previously found in [@woodwirk/hugo-lithium-search](https://github.com/woodwirk/hugo-lithium-search))
- offline fonts (`woff2`)
- offline photo gallery from PhotoSwipe
