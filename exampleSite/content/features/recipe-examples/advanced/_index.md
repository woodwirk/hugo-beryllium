# Instructions

1. Install a version of Hugo on your computer
1. Install git (or download a Hugo theme directly)
1. Follow the Hugo quickstart guide or the setup on the [About]( {{< ref "about" >}} ) page
    - If you're not using the `git submodule` approach, you will need to adapt the quickstart to your configuration.
1. If you don't want to use the `hugo` terminal commands, you can also create text file content directly.
