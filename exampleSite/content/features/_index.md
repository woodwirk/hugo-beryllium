title: hugo-beryllium Features
layout: list-section

Try changing the [layout]( {{< ref "/features/theme-info/layouts" >}} ) of this page between the following:

- `section`
    - List squares linking to nested sections (folders with `_index.md` at the top). List regular pages at the same level below them, in date grouping/order.
- `list`
    - List pages by year published, under grouped headings. Does not show pages nested within a branch/section.
- `list-title`
    - List pages by title, without grouped headings. Does not show pages nested within a branch/section.
- `list-section`
    - List pages by section (folders with `_index.md` at the top). Sort by section weight. Does not show pages if they aren't in a section.
- `list-section-tags`
    - Same as above. Sort by section weight. Instead of reading time, show the top 3 tags on the side. Does not show pages if they aren't in a section.

You will notice that some pages may not be rendered, depending on the layout.
