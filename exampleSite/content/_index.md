This is an example website for rendering notes from _plain text_ files using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and the hugo-beryllium theme. It doubles as the example site documentation. This theme was intended for notes, but you can use it however you'd like.

The theme files are available at [@woodwirk/hugo-beryllium](https://github.com/woodwirk/hugo-beryllium).
