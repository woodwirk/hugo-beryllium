This is an example website for rendering notes from _plain text_ files using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and the hugo-beryllium theme. It doubles as the example site documentation. This theme was intended for notes, but you can use it however you'd like.

The theme files are available at [@woodwirk/hugo-beryllium](https://github.com/woodwirk/hugo-beryllium).

Below you'll find all of the top-level folders in your `/content/` directory. Click one of the squares to see its content.

At any time, you can also click the "Random" link in the navigation bar. Look out, this feature is experimental. You may have to try a few times to get something of interest.
