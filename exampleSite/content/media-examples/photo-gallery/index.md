Photoswipe provides image gallery functionality. A version is archived in this repository/theme.

Snippet:

```
{ {< gallery folder="public-domain" >} }
```

In order to display the shortcode above, additional spacing was necessary. The real shortcode should have adjacent braces like ``{{`` and ``}}``.

{{< gallery folder="public-domain" >}}
